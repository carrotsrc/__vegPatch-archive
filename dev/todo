VegPatch 0.2
============

System:
- License old files, always license new files
- Spend some time reviewing the initialisation include tree and cleaning it up. Maybe moving it into it's own file.
- Implement a session handler to use the database for holding the session data
- Write a routine that generates a valid submit link which includes any specified global params in the url
- Consolidate stdint and kbasic into vpatch in the panels (UPDATE: some progress)
- Separate plugins into spaces
- Make the install process easier (UPDATE: some progress)

Resources:
- Create a more comprehensive query system.
- Implement subqueries on first relatee: (subquery)<(subquery).
- ResMan::getResourceFromId() returns the reference for the handler. The array should reflect this.

DevTools:
- All tools should be locked down

Library/Straps:
- Add ability to have input and modify vars when loading strap
- Do redundency checks on layoutcfg and areacfg, output current id and rid if they exist

Library/Plugins
- LocalRQ should check to see if an instance's channel has already been run to avoid rechecking the same channel

System/Module:
- Rename methods and properties of Component and Panel to more descriptive, less confusing names
- Change panel<>component request structure to a class rather than an associative array

System/Helpers
- Session Implement serialising of session data in helper to use database
- StrSan has inconsistant behaviour on mysqlDesanatize

System/Plugins
- Plugin manager should keep track of already included plugins so don't need to use include_once

Asset/gscript.js
- Add code for handling IE6 to gscript including async requests
- Request queue in gscript always uses previous callback. Why this behaviour?
- Have library function for dynamically loading js and css files. Include redundency check so scripts are not loaded twice and screwing it up.
- Dynamically loaded scripts will be extension scripts for core component libraries
